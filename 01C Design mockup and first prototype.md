<h1>01C Design mockup and first prototype</h1>
<h2>Design Mockup</h2>
<p>Goal 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Ensure womenâ€™s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life</p>

<p>Why are woman under-represented in politic worldwide? Is it their unwillingness to become politicians or gender gaps in political ambition?</p>

<h3>Number of seats held by women in the US national parliaments (number)</h3>

<p>This design mockup include 4 main indicators; (1) Year, (2) President, (3) Number of seats held by men and (4) Number of seats held by women</p>

<p>The number of seats held by men and women are plotted over a seating plan template. It is obvious that the number of seats held by women barely increase over a decade. The biggest jump of the number of American female politicians was this year, 2022, under Donald Trump and Joe Biden's time.</p>

<p>To wisely use the UNSDG data set, instead of exploring deeper into one country (e.g. the US politics), I will make a comparison between countries. For example, the country with a low and a high Gender Inequality Index (GII) OR male vs female leader countries.</p>
